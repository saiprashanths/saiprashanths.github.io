My name is Sai. I'm working on a startup focused on multimodal learning and understanding video content. 
Previously, I was a Senior Applied Scientist at Bing, where I built deep learning models for email inference 
and other text applications. A long time ago, I was at Stanford, teaching robots to fly and adivsed by [Andrew Ng](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ang/group.html).
