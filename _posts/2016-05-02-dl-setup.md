title: A Guide to Setting up your Machine for Deep Learning from Scratch (Ubuntu)
---

After setting up machines (and helping others do it) with the suite of commonly used deep learning toolkits [1] for the N-th time, 
I decided it might be useful to put together a simple guide. While conceptually simple, figuring out package dependencies, getting the 
drivers working, et al turn out to be fairly non-trivial in practice. Until someone builds a deep learning ready Docker/VM, hope this 
helps a few of you save some time. Check it out: [https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-setup](https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-setup)

This was tested on a 64 bit machine with Nvidia Titan X, running Ubuntu 14.04
